          Tokyo (Silene Oliveira) is a fictional character in the Netflix series
          Money Heist, portrayed by Úrsula Corberó.[1] The de facto protagonist
          of the series, she is the unreliable narrator[2] and a runaway robber
          who is scouted by the Professor to participate in his heists. Tokyo is
          a young thief on the run from the police after a failed robbery in
          which her boyfriend was killed. She was hired by the Professor to help
          in carrying out a heist of the Royal Mint in Madrid. Together with the
          other seven robbers chosen for the heist, she is taken to a secluded
          villa where they plan the heist for five months. The Professor asks
          each of the robbers to choose a city name to hide their identities
          during the robbery and she chooses Tokyo.
